### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a computer science student at the Silesian University of Technology, passionate about game development with game publishing experience.
I love learning new programming languages and skills for self-development.

Skills: C++/C#/Unity/SFML

As a solo game-dev I'm known as GraczekGames <br />

I have loads of projects done using Unity game engine and C#. Two of them are published.<br /><br />

My first published game is a first person parkour game with online leaderboard - AirRunner:<br />
